        <h2>GLYCOLIC + SALICYLIC ACID</h2>
        <p class="content">Glycolic acid is an alpha hydroxy acid (AHA) known for its ability to exfoliate the skin's surface, promoting cell turnover and revealing smoother, brighter skin. Salicylic acid, on the other hand, is a beta hydroxy acid (BHA) that penetrates deep into the pores, exfoliating within the follicles and removing excess oil, dead skin cells, and debris. Together, they provide comprehensive exfoliation, preventing clogged pores and breakouts while improving overall skin texture. Salicylic acid is particularly effective at targeting acne preventing the formation of clogged pores and inflammatory acne lesions. Glycolic acid complements this by removing dead skin cells and excess oil from the skin's surface, preventing pore blockages and further breakouts.</p>

        <h2>NIACINAMIDE + VITAMIN C</h2>
        <p class="content">Niacinamide helps to reduce the appearance of dark spots, hyperpigmentation, and uneven skin tone, while vitamin C (ascorbic acid) is a potent antioxidant that brightens the complexion and fades pigmentation. Niacinamide has anti-inflammatory properties that help calm redness, irritation, and acne. Vitamin C also exhibits soothing effects and can reduce inflammation, making this combination beneficial for those with sensitive or acne-prone skin. Niacinamide strengthens the skin's barrier function. Vitamin C boosts this effect by promoting collagen production and supporting skin repair processes.</p>

        <h2>FOR DRY SKIN</h2>
        <p class="content">Hyaluronic acid offers exceptional benefits for dry skin, serving as a powerful hydrator due to its remarkable moisture-retaining properties. As a humectant, hyaluronic acid attracts water molecules from the environment and binds them to the skin, providing intense hydration and replenishing moisture lost from environmental factors or aging. Lightweight, non-greasy texture ensures quick absorption into the skin, delivering instant relief without leaving any residue. Beyond hydration, hyaluronic acid soothes irritation, reduces redness, and plumps fine lines and wrinkles.</p>

        <h2>FOR SENSITIVE SKIN</h2>
        <p class="content">For sensitive skin, one of the most beneficial acids is lactic acid. As an alpha hydroxy acid (AHA), lactic acid offers gentle exfoliation without causing excessive irritation or dryness. Lactic acid has larger molecules that penetrate the skin more slowly, resulting in a milder exfoliating effect. This makes it well-suited for sensitive skin types prone to redness, irritation, or inflammation. Lactic acid helps to remove dead skin cells, unclog pores, and improve skin texture, resulting in a smoother, more radiant complexion. It can also stimulate collagen production, contributing to firmer, more youthful-looking skin over time. When using lactic acid for sensitive skin, it's essential to start with a lower concentration and patch-test new products to ensure compatibility. </p>

        <h2>FOR COMBINATION</h2>
        <p class="content">For combination skin-type, Salicylic acid is a beta hydroxy acid (BHA) known for its ability to penetrate deep into the pores, making it effective for addressing both oily and acne-prone areas, common concerns in combination skin. Salicylic acid helps to unclog pores, remove excess oil, and prevent breakouts, making it especially useful for the T-zone or areas prone to acne and congestion. Another benefit of salicylic acid for combination skin is its exfoliating properties. By gently sloughing away dead skin cells, salicylic acid promotes smoother, more even skin texture, addressing dry patches often found in combination skin while also helping to refine the appearance of enlarged pores. </p>
